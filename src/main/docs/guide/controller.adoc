Configuration beans can be injected into the application with just like any other beans. As a demonstration,
create a controller where the beans are constructor injected. The `StadiumConfiguration` class has two
instances, so for injection we need to use the `@Named` annotation with a qualifier name to specify the bean.

<1> Injection of configuration beans; `@Named` annotation is needed to choose which `StadiumConfiguration` instance is retrieved.

In the browser go to http://localhost:8080/my/team and http://localhost:8080/my/stadium.
To test the app, run `./gradlew test`
