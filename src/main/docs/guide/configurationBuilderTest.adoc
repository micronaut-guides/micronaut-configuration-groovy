We can validate `@ConfigurationBuilder` is applied properly with the following spock test. The test format is similar to previous tests.

[source,groovy]
.src/test/groovy/example/micronaut/TeamConfigurationSpec.groovy
----
include::{sourceDir}/src/test/groovy/example/micronaut/TeamConfigurationSpec.groovy[tag=teamConfigSpecBuilder]
----

<1> Properties which will invoke the builder methods on `TeamAdmin.Builder`
<2> The builder object is now configured, so we must run `build()` on it to create the `TeamAdmin` object
<3> Verify the object is created with the `applicaton.yml` properties
